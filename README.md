## Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) carries immense health and economic implications, globally.  North America, the Middle East, and Central Asia carry the highest prevalence of CVD, while Eastern Europe and Central Asia have the highest mortality rates attributable to CVD. Risk assessment is a critical step in primary prevention. Current guidelines employ pooled cohort equations (PCE) to calculate the 10-year risk for hard ASCVD. Also various models currently are used in clinical practice to predict ASCVD. However, these models may misclassify risk either by underestimating or overestimating actual observed risk in populations with different comorbidities or with different demographic or socioeconomic determinants. In this study, we developed a clinically-based ASCVD prediction model that can fill the gap in current methodologies.
